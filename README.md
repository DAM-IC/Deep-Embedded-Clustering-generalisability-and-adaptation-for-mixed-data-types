# Deep-Embedded-Clustering-generalisability-and-adaptation-for-mixed-data-types
This code was used for a scientific publication where we we recreated a Deep Embedded Clustering model on a populations of ICU patients. We tested the model's generalisability onto a population of ICU patients from anoterh hospital. We Aslo created the X-DEC model adaptation, which uses an XVAE to integrate mixed datatypes, and tested its generalisability as well.
